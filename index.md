## Emma Templeton

Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth. I work with [Thalia Wheatley](http://www.wheatlab.com/) and [Luke Chang](https://cosanlab.com/). The question that motivates my research is...

What makes conversation "good"?

I use a data-driven, naturalistic approaches to try and answer this question.
