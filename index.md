# About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth. I work with [Thalia Wheatley](http://www.wheatlab.com/) and [Luke Chang](https://cosanlab.com/). The question that motivates my research is...

> What makes conversation "good"?

I use data-driven, naturalistic approaches to try and answer this question.

Before graduate school, I received my A.B. in Psychology from Harvard where I worked with [Jason Mitchell](https://jasonmitchell.fas.harvard.edu/) and [Diana Tamir](https://psnlab.princeton.edu/). Then, I worked as [Jamil Zaki](https://www.ssnl.stanford.edu/)'s lab manager at Stanford.
